Brief Introduction About Myself

I am a full-stack developer who like to build websites and also work with back-end systems. 
I enjoy writing code both for front-end and back-end, and also I’m learning about networks and security.
I do some ethical hacking to understand how systems can be broken and fixed.

I also work with data, like analyzing and understanding trends.
I like trying new tools and learning by doing. 
Right now I’m also learning German language and practicing trading using order flow system. 
I believe doing real projects is the best way for me to grow. Sometimes I make mistakes but I always try to improve.
